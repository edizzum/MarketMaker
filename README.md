# MarketMaker
Why a transparent intermediary platform for marketing when there are intermediaries for everything else?

MarketMaker is a marketing platform designed for project owners who may lack the necessary connections or experience in marketing and PR. MarketMaker hosts content creators and community managers with high engagement and follower counts, allowing project owners to utilize their marketing budget efficiently and profitably on a platform that benefits both parties. Instead of wasting users time with promises of airdrops, we provide real value, ensuring they can earn money from their work.

Why is there a need for such a platform?

Many scam projects will be eliminated from our system through WorldID verification, ensuring that only reliable projects are included.
As everyone knows, promoting and announcing any project requires high budgets. Additionally, you need to have communication with many people. Through MarketMaker, Community Managers and Content Creators will be ready to promote your product via WorldID in our system.
So why should Community Managers and Content Creators use this platform?

Firstly, many platforms require different verifications to prove that you are not a bot user. MarketMaker easily overcomes this step thanks to WorldID.
Many people do not get paid after doing promotions. We see this as the most important point. People can see the locked amount in the pool and their share before promoting. The requirements are clearly stated in our system. Thanks to 100% transparency, everyone benefits from MarketMaker.

## Features

### Trust and Authenticity

To address trust issues and the concern of “Is this a real person?”, everyone is required to register with WorldID, for eliminating this worry. To prevent bots, only one Twitter account can be linked to a single WorldID.

### Web3Auth Integration

For those unfamiliar with Web3, we offer the ability to sign in using Web3Auth with almost anything like E-mail, Gmail, Phone Number, or Discord. Web3Auth creates an EOA wallet for these users, which can then be linked to WorldID.

### Pool Creation and Management

Project owners can open a pool on the Arbitrum chain with MM Tokens created using LayerZero’s OFT standard, within the budget they allocate on our platform. It’s important to note that users can open a pool on Arbitrum by paying a fee for opening the pool from any network.


### Content Creator Tiers

Content creators are assigned Tiers (1–3) based on their Twitter post engagement, follower count, and profile visits, and can mint their NFTs created with LayerZero’s ONFT standard. Tier holders produce content based on the project owner’s specified requirements. After meeting the requirements, content creators can claim their rewards by checking their progress.

### Reward Distribution

Claiming rewards isn’t immediate. The project owner sets a deadline, up to a maximum of one month, and all content creators participating in the pool will share rewards according to their Tier ratios by this deadline.

## Revenue Model

The MarketMaker Team earns a 5% commission from the liquidity that is added to the pool by the user.
